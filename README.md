# RN_NavigationEx

Created in 2025 to show examples for navigation using Expo Router and typscript

## BasicStackNav

This app simply shows how to set up an \_layout.tsx file in the app folder along with pages
for each of the screens. The \_layout.tsx shows the Root Layout

## BasicTabNav

This app shows how to use the \_layout.tsx file along with the (tabs) folder so that you
can utilize a Tab navigation. Also in the app folder is an additional file title
how_to_add_entry_screen.txt that explains how to combine a Stack Nav and a Tab Nav to make it
so that you can have an entry screen that loads first and then enter the Tab Nav.
